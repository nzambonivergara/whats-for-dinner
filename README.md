## Overview

The What's for dinner? app helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. The app was build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A provided comp was matched utilizing HTML & CSS. The app includes the following functionality:
- When a user selects a dish option or the "Entire Meal" option and then clicks the “Let’s Cook!” button, the user sees a random dish from the list of possible dishes for that category or a side, entree, and dessert option if "Entire Meal" is chosen.
- When the dish name appears, the cookpot icon disappears.
- The user can click a clear button, which clears the page of any message. When the clear button is clicked and the food is removed, the image of the cookpot should re-appear.
- User should not be able to click the “Let’s Cook” button for a recipe unless they have selected an option.
- The user can click an “Add a Recipe” button, which will display a form to add a new recipe at the bottom of the page.
- The user can add a type and a name, click the “Add New” recipe and that recipe will be added to the appropriate list.
- When a new recipe is added, that recipe automatically displays instead of the cookpot icon.
- When a user tries to add to a recipe type that does not exist, the new category gets added.

## Next Steps

The application could be further improved by implementing local storage, including a login page for users, allowing the user to favorite or delete a recipe, as well as an all recipe interface. In addition, the layout and presentation could be further improved to be adaptable to different screen sizes and devices as well as more animations and user responsive buttons.
